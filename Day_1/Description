snakePattern is a static method that takes a 2D integer array matrix as input.
It returns an ArrayList containing integers, representing the elements visited in the snake pattern.
Initializes an empty ArrayList named snake to store the elements visited in the snake pattern.
Determines the size of the square matrix by obtaining the length of the input matrix (assuming it's a square matrix).
Iterates through each row of the matrix.
For even-indexed rows (0, 2, 4, ...), it traverses from left to right and adds each element to the snake ArrayList.
For odd-indexed rows (1, 3, 5, ...), it traverses from right to left and adds each element to the snake ArrayList.
Returns the ArrayList containing the elements visited in the snake pattern.
