Parameters:

head1 and head2: Represent the heads of two linked lists.
Variables:

result: Points to the head of the resulting linked list containing the intersection.
tail: Points to the last node in the resulting linked list.
Logic:

Initialize result and tail as null.
Use a while loop to iterate through both linked lists as long as both head1 and head2 are not null.
Inside the loop:
If the data at the current nodes (head1.data and head2.data) is equal:
If result is null, create a new node with the value and set it as result. Set tail to result.
If result exists, create a new node with the value and set it as the next node of tail. Move tail to this new node.
Move both head1 and head2 to their respective next nodes.
If head1.data is less than head2.data, move head1 to its next node.
If head1.data is greater than head2.data, move head2 to its next node.
Continue this process until either head1 or head2 becomes null.
Return:

The method returns the head of the resulting linked list (result), which contains nodes representing the intersection of elements from both input linked lists.
