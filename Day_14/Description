Parameters:

root1 and root2: Represent the roots of the two binary trees.
Logic:

Checks if both root1 and root2 are null. If both are null, it returns true as identical.
If one tree is null and the other is not, they cannot be identical, so it returns false.
Compares the data of the current nodes (root1.data and root2.data). If they are equal:
Recursively checks the left subtrees of both trees (root1.left and root2.left).
Recursively checks the right subtrees of both trees (root1.right and root2.right).
Returns true only if both current nodes are equal and their corresponding left and right subtrees are also identical.
If at any point the data of the current nodes are not equal, it returns false immediately.
