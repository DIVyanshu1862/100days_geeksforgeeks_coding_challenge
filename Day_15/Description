root: Root node of the binary tree.
Logic:

Checks whether the given binary tree is symmetric.
If the root is null, it is considered symmetric (return true).
Checks if the left subtree and the right subtree of the root node are mirror images using the isMirror function.
Return:

Returns true if the tree is symmetric (left and right subtrees are mirror images), false otherwise.
