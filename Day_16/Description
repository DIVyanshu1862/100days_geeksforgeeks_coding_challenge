Parameters:

node: Represents the current node in the AVL tree.
data: The value to be inserted into the AVL tree.
Logic:

If the node is null, creates a new node with the given data.
Compares the data to be inserted (data) with the data in the current node and traverses the tree accordingly.
Recalculates the height of the current node based on the maximum height of its left and right subtrees.
Calculates the balance factor (bf) of the node.
Performs necessary rotations (leftRotate and rightRotate) to balance the tree if the balance factor indicates an imbalance.
rightRotate and leftRotate Methods:
These methods perform right and left rotations, respectively, to balance the tree.
getBalance Method:
Calculates the balance factor (height(left subtree) - height(right subtree)) of the given node.
height Method:
Retrieves the height of the given node.
