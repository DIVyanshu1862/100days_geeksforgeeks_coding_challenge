This method takes in two parameters:

arr[][]: A 2D array representing the square matrix.
N: An integer denoting the size of the square matrix.
Variables Initialization
maxZeros: Tracks the maximum number of zeros found in any column.
columnIndex: Holds the index of the column with the most zeros, initialized as -1.
currZeros: Counts the number of zeros in the current column (i) by checking each element in that column. If the element is zero, currZeros increments.
