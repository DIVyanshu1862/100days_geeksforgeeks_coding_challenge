Renamed variables for better readability (currZeros instead of currz, maxZeros instead of max_z).
In the inner loop, it checks for zeros in each column (arr[j][i] == 0) and increments currZeros accordingly.
Updated the comparison logic to track the column index (res) with the maximum number of zeros (maxZeros).
This modified code should correctly identify the column index that contains the maximum number of zeros in the given square matrix.
