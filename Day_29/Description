MyQueue() is the constructor method that initializes the queue. It sets both the front and rear of the queue to 0.
push(int x) function adds an element x to the queue. It places x at the rear position in the array and then increments rear to prepare for the next element to be added.
pop() function removes and returns the element at the front of the queue. It first checks if the queue is empty (front equals rear). If it is empty, it returns -1. Otherwise, it retrieves the element at the front index, increments front to point to the next element in the queue, and returns the retrieved element.
