Parameters: Takes a string pattern as input, representing the pattern of increase and decrease.
Return Type: Returns a string that represents the minimum number based on the given pattern.
n: Represents the length of the pattern string.
result: An integer array of length n to store the resulting number sequence.
Initializes the result array with a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), assuming an ascending sequence as the initial sequence.
Iterates through the pattern string to identify 'D' (decrease) segments.
When 'D' is found, it identifies the start and end indices of the decreasing section.
Calls the reverse method to reverse the section of the result array corresponding to the 'D' pattern.
