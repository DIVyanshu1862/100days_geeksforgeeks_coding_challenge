arr: The input array of integers.
n: The size of the input array.
k: The target sum for which pairs are being counted.
Create a HashMap called seen to store the numbers encountered so far and their frequencies.
Initialize a variable count to keep track of the number of pairs found.
Loop through each element (num) in the input array.
For each num, calculate the value b which is k - num. This b represents the number needed to form a pair with num such that their sum is equal to k.
Check if the b value exists in the seen map.
If it exists, increment count by the frequency of b in the seen map. This means there are seen.get(b) pairs that sum up to k.
Update the seen map by incrementing the frequency of the current number (num).
Once the loop completes, return the final count, which represents the total number of pairs found in the array that sum up to k.
