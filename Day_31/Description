Parameters:
arr[]: An array of strings.
n: An integer indicating the number of strings in the array.
Checks if the array is empty. If so, it returns an empty string.
Checks if there's only one string in the array. If so, it returns that string as it is the only common prefix.
Initializes variables:
word1: Set as the first string in the array.
word2: An empty string initially.
result: A string to store the common prefix.
Starts a loop from the second string in the array (i=1) to the last string (i<n).
Compares each consecutive string (word2) with the current common prefix (word1).
Using a while loop, it compares characters at each position of word1 and word2.
If the characters match, it adds that character to the result string (building the common prefix).
If the characters don't match, it breaks out of the loop.
Sets word1 as the updated common prefix (result).
Checks if the final result is an empty string.
If it's empty, returns "-1" as there's no common prefix.
Otherwise, returns the found common prefix.
