The method takes in an array of strings arr and an integer n representing the number of strings in the array.
It aims to find the longest common prefix among the strings in the array.
It starts by checking if the input array has only one element. If it does, the method returns that single element as the longest common prefix.

It initializes word1 with the first string in the array (arr[0]), word2 as an empty string, and result as an empty string.

The method then iterates through the array starting from the second element (arr[1]).
There was an issue with string comparison where == was used instead of the .equals() method. In Java, using == checks for reference equality, not content equality. Thus, result.equals("") is used to check if the result string is empty.
If the input array is empty, the method returns an empty string.
