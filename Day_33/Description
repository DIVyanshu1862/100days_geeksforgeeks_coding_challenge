nums[]: Input array containing integers.
n: The number of elements in the input array.
It initializes a new array pA of type long[] to store the products of all elements except the element at the current index.
It iterates through each element in the nums[] array using a for loop.
Inside the outer loop, it has another nested for loop to calculate the product of all elements except the element at index i.
Within the inner loop, for each element at index i, it initializes a variable c to 1.
It multiplies all elements except the one at index i to update the product in the pA array.
The if condition if(i == j) continue; ensures that the element at the current index is skipped for multiplication.
After calculating the product excluding the element at index i, it assigns this product to the pA array at index i.
