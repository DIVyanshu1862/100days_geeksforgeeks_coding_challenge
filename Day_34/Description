arr[]: The input array of integers that needs to be rearranged.
n: The number of elements in the array.
Two queues, pos for positive integers and neg for negative integers, are created using Java's LinkedList implementation of the Queue interface.
The code traverses the input array and separates positive integers (including 0) into the pos queue and negative integers into the neg queue.
An index i is initialized to 0 to keep track of the position where elements will be placed in the output array.
The code uses a while loop that continues until i reaches n (the total number of elements in the array).
