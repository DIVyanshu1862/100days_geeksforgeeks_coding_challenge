array[]: The array to be partitioned.
a and b: The range values.
start: Marks the boundary for elements less than a.
mid: Traverses the array.
last: Marks the boundary for elements greater than b.
Initialize start to 0, mid to 0, and last to array.length - 1.
Loop while mid is less than or equal to last.
Within the loop:
If array[mid] is less than a:
Swap array[mid] with array[start].
Increment both start and mid pointers.
Else, if array[mid] is between a and b (inclusive):
Increment only the mid pointer.
Else, if array[mid] is greater than b:
Swap array[mid] with array[last].
Decrement the last pointer.
The loop continues until mid crosses or reaches last.
