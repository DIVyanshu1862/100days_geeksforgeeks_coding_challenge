arr[] - an integer array
n - an integer representing the size of the array
k - an integer used as a divisor
It initializes a counter variable count to 0 and calculates the threshold value nbyk (which is n/k).

It uses an unordered_map named m to store the frequency of each element in the array. The key of the map is the array element, and the value is the frequency of that element in the array.

The function then iterates through the array:

For each element arr[i], it increments its count in the unordered_map m.
If the count of the current element arr[i] in the map exceeds the threshold (nbyk), it sets the count of that element in the map to INT_MIN (the minimum value for an integer in C++) and increments the count variable.
After iterating through the array, the function returns the count, which represents the number of elements that appear more than n/k times in the array.
