The method areIsomorphic takes in two strings, str1 and str2.
It first checks if the lengths of the two strings are different. If they are, it immediately returns false since isomorphic strings must have equal lengths.
The method initializes a HashMap called mapping to store the mappings between characters of str1 and str2. It also initializes a HashSet called visited to keep track of characters in str2 that have already been mapped.
It iterates through both strings using a for loop.
