Input Parameters:

int[] a: An array of integers.
int N: An integer representing the number of elements to be considered for the subset.
Method Explanation:

minSubset method takes in an array a and an integer N.
It sorts the array in ascending order using Arrays.sort(a).
Then, it calculates the total sum of all elements in the array using the variable totalSum.
The method iterates through the sorted array from the end (N - 1 to 0).
Inside the loop, it subtracts the current element from totalSum and adds it to subsetSum.
The count of considered elements (minElements) decreases for each element added to the subset.
If at any point the subsetSum becomes greater than the totalSum, the method returns the current count of elements (minElements).
If no subset satisfies the condition, the method returns 1.
