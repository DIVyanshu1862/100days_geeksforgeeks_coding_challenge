Sorts arrays A and B in ascending order using Arrays.sort().
Initializes a variable sum as a long to accumulate the sum of absolute differences.
Iterates through the arrays using a loop from 0 to N-1.
At each index i, calculates the absolute difference between A[i] and B[i] using Math.abs() and adds it to the sum.
Finally, returns the calculated sum.
