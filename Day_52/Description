It takes two strings, a and b, as input parameters.
Checks if the lengths of the strings a and b are different. If they are different, the method returns false immediately because strings of different lengths cannot be anagrams.
Converts strings a and b into character arrays arr and brr, respectively.
Sorts both character arrays using Arrays.sort() method.
Compares each character of the sorted arrays. If any character at a corresponding index is different, it returns false indicating that the strings are not anagrams.
If the loop completes without finding any differing characters, it returns true, confirming that the strings are anagrams.
