Class Definition: The code defines a class named Compute.

Static Method getMinMax: This method is declared as static, which means it belongs to the class itself and can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.
Parameters:
a[]: An array of long integers.
n: The number of elements in the array.
Functionality:
Initializes max and min variables to the first element of the array a[].
Iterates through the array starting from the second element.
Compares each element of the array with the current max and min values using Math.max() and Math.min() respectively.
Updates max and min values if a larger or smaller element is found during the iteration.
Finally, returns a Pair object containing the minimum and maximum values found in the array.
