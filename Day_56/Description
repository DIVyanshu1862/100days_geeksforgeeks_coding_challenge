The method name nknode doesn't clearly indicate its purpose. Consider using a more descriptive name for clarity.

The count variable is of type double, but it could be of type int since it's counting the number of nodes in an integer-based linked list. There's no need for floating-point arithmetic here.

The code assumes that k is a valid divisor of the total number of nodes in the linked list. If the value of k is larger than the number of nodes, this code might not behave as expected.

The conditional statement if (d == 1) returns the data of the first node. However, this might not be the intended behavior. If d is 1, it should return the data of the head node, not the node before the head node.

The code doesn't handle edge cases well, such as an empty linked list (head == null) or when k is 0.

Additionally, the code could be simplified and made more efficient by directly traversing to the desired node without counting all nodes in the list.
