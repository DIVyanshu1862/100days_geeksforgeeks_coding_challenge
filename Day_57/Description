postOrder(Node root) Method:
This method initializes an empty ArrayList<Integer> named a to store the post-order traversal result.
It calls the helper method g(a, root) to perform the post-order traversal of the binary tree.
Finally, it returns the ArrayList<Integer> containing the post-order traversal result.
Helper Method:
g(ArrayList<Integer> a, Node root) Method:
This method performs the actual post-order traversal.
It is a recursive method that traverses the tree in a post-order manner.
If the current node (root) is null, it returns immediately.
It recursively visits the left subtree by calling g(a, root.left).
It then recursively visits the right subtree by calling g(a, root.right).
After visiting the subtrees, it adds the data of the current node to the ArrayList a.
