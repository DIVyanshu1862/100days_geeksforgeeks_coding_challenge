The class GfG contains a method deleteNode to delete a node at a given position in a linked list.
The method takes two parameters: head is the head of the linked list, and x is the position of the node to be deleted.
It checks if the linked list is empty. If so, it returns null as there is nothing to delete.
If x is 1, it means the first node needs to be deleted. In this case, it updates the head to point to the next node and returns the updated head.
Otherwise, it traverses the linked list to find the node at position x. It uses two pointers, curr and prev, to keep track of the current and previous nodes.
If the given position is invalid (beyond the length of the linked list), it returns the original head without making any changes.
If the position is valid, it updates the pointers to skip the node at position x, effectively removing it from the linked list.
Finally, it returns the updated head of the linked list.
