The levelOrder method initializes an empty ArrayList named ans to store the result.

It checks if the input node is null. If it is, an empty ArrayList is returned.

A Queue of type Node named q is created using the LinkedList implementation.

The root node is added to the queue.

A while loop is used to traverse the tree level by level until the queue becomes empty.

Inside the loop:

The front node of the queue (curr) is removed, and its data is added to the ans ArrayList.
If the left child of the current node is not null, it is added to the queue.
If the right child of the current node is not null, it is also added to the queue.
Once the traversal is complete, the ArrayList ans containing the level order traversal is returned.
