The Solution class contains a method named insert that takes a Node (root of the tree) and an integer Key as parameters.

If the root is null (indicating an empty tree), a new node is created with the given key, and this new node is returned.

If the key is smaller than the current node's data, the insert method is called recursively on the left subtree.

If the key is greater than the current node's data, the insert method is called recursively on the right subtree.

Finally, the modified root (after insertion) is returned.
