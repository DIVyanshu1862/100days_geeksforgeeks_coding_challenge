dfsHelper method:

This method takes the current node, an array to track visited nodes, the adjacency list of the graph, and a list to store the DFS traversal result.
It marks the current node as visited and adds it to the result list.
It then recursively calls dfsHelper for all adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet.
dfsOfGraph method:

This method initializes the visited array and the result list.
It calls the dfsHelper method with the starting node (0 in this case), the visited array, the adjacency list, and the result list.
Finally, it returns the result list containing the DFS traversal of the graph.
Here's an example of how to use this class:
