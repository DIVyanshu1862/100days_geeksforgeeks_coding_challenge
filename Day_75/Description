Palindrome method:

It uses two pointers (i and j) to iterate through the string from both ends towards the center.
It checks if the characters at the current positions are equal. If not, it returns false.
If the loop completes without returning, it means the string is a palindrome, and it returns true.
CountPS method:

It initializes a count variable to 0.
It uses two nested loops to iterate through all possible substrings of the given string.
For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome using the Palindrome method and if its length is greater than or equal to 2. If true, it increments the count.
Finally, it returns the count.
