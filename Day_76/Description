The method starts by initializing an empty ArrayList ans, which will store the maximum values of each subarray.

A for loop iterates through the array from index 0 to n - k. This loop represents the starting index of each subarray.

Within the outer loop, there is an inner while loop with a counter j initialized to 0. This loop is used to iterate through each element within the current subarray of size k.

Inside the inner loop, there is a check to find the maximum element (max) within the current subarray. The variable temp is used as an index to traverse the subarray.

Once the maximum element within the subarray is found, it is added to the ans ArrayList.

The outer loop continues to iterate through the array, and the process is repeated for each subarray.

Finally, the ans ArrayList containing the maximum values of each subarray is returned.
