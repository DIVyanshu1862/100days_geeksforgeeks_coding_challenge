buildHeap method:

This method is used to build a max heap from the given array arr of size n.
The loop starts from the last non-leaf node (n/2-1) and iterates backward towards the root.
For each node, the heapify method is called to ensure that the heap property is maintained.
heapify method:

This method is responsible for maintaining the max heap property.
It takes the array arr, its size n, and the index i as parameters.
It compares the element at index i with its left and right children (if they exist).
If either child is greater than the current element, the largest index is updated accordingly.
If the largest index is not equal to the current index i, a swap is performed, and the method is recursively called on the affected subtree.
heapSort method:

This is the main sorting method that uses the heap sort algorithm.
It first builds a max heap using the buildHeap method.
Then, it iteratively swaps the root (maximum element) with the last element in the heap and calls heapify to maintain the heap property.
The loop continues until the entire array is sorted.
