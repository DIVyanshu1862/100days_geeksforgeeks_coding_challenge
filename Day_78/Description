maxsumsubArray:

This method implements Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a subarray in a given 1D array.
It initializes two variables, curr and max, where curr represents the current sum of elements, and max represents the maximum sum encountered so far.
The method iterates through the array, updating curr by adding each element. If curr becomes greater than max, max is updated. If curr becomes negative, it is reset to 0.
The final maximum sum (max) of the subarray is returned.
