The palindrome method checks if a given string is a palindrome. It iterates through the characters of the string from the beginning and end simultaneously, comparing characters at corresponding positions. If any pair of characters doesn't match, the method returns false, indicating that the string is not a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns true.

The CountPS method takes two parameters - a string S and an integer N. It aims to count the number of palindromic substrings of length greater than or equal to 2 in the given string S. It uses nested loops to iterate over all possible substrings of S and checks if each substring is a palindrome using the palindrome method. If a palindromic substring is found, the count pal is incremented. The method finally returns the total count of palindromic substrings.
