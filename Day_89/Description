The condition adj.get(i).get(j) == 1 might not be correct. It checks if there's a direct connection between vertices i and j. However, in an adjacency list representation, adj.get(i).get(j) might not directly indicate an edge. Instead, you should check if j is present in the adjacency list of i.

The unionByRank() method is typically used for weighted union in disjoint set data structures. But in your case, you seem to be intending to union vertices i and j if they are connected. For that purpose, you should use the union() method.
