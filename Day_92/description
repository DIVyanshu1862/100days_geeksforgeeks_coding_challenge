You're iterating through the array of characters (arr) to identify the positions of police officers ('P') and thieves.
You're storing the indexes of police officers and thieves in separate ArrayLists.
Then, you're trying to iterate through both lists to find the optimal pairing of police officers and thieves based on the constraint of distance (k).
However, there are a few issues and improvements that need to be addressed:

You're missing the import statement for ArrayList. You need to import it before using it.
You're not sorting the police and thieves ArrayLists, which is necessary for the algorithm to work correctly.
Your algorithm doesn't handle all possible cases. For example, what if there are no police officers or thieves?
You need to return the total number of thieves caught, but your implementation is returning the count of caught pairs (ans).
