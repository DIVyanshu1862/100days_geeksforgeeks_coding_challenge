It initializes an array temp of size 26 to keep track of the frequencies of each character in the string.
It iterates through the input string s and updates the frequency count of each character in the temp array.
It then iterates through the temp array to find the minimum and maximum frequencies (min and max) and stores them.
It uses a HashSet set to keep track of the distinct frequencies encountered.
It checks if there are more than 2 distinct frequencies in the set, in which case it returns false.
If the minimum frequency min is equal to the maximum frequency max, it returns true.
Otherwise, it counts the occurrences of the minimum and maximum frequencies in the temp array (count1 and count2 respectively).
It checks if both count1 and count2 are greater than 1, in which case it returns false.
It checks if the minimum frequency min is 1 and occurs only once (count1 == 1), in which case it returns true.
Finally, it checks if the absolute difference between max and min is 1 and count2 is 1. If so, it returns true, otherwise false.
