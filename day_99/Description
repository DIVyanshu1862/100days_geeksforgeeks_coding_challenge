Objective:
The code aims to remove duplicate characters from a given string while preserving the order of characters.

Approach:

Utilizes a LinkedHashSet to store unique characters from the input string while maintaining their order.
Converts the LinkedHashSet to an ArrayList to maintain order.
Constructs the final string using a StringBuilder.
Process:

Iterate through each character of the input string.
Add each character to the LinkedHashSet. Duplicates are automatically removed due to the nature of LinkedHashSet.
Convert the LinkedHashSet to an ArrayList to maintain the order of characters.
Iterate through the ArrayList, appending each character to a StringBuilder.
Return the string representation of the StringBuilder, which contains the original string with duplicate characters removed
